Version 1.9.8
====================
* modified various functions to permit setting various volumeIO write properties (volumeDataClass, volumeDataType) prior to writing a volume.
* prior to this, all volumes were written as real/signed-int ... which simplifies things, but may adversely effect precision of float values.

Version 1.9.7
====================
* modified various c++ routines to reflect changes made to the minc2 api.
* most of the changes were related to change of variable type (eg., misize_t, hsize_t)

Version 1.9.6
====================
* removed rgl as a depends

Version 1.9.5
====================
* converted the world <--> voxel routines to Rcpp/C++
* added functionality to coord conversion code to permit passing of multiple coords
* removed the old coordinate conversion code
* added function *rmincUtil.getVolumeDimnames* to provide volume dimnames in volume order
* made changes to have rmincIO play better with volume not in zyx order
* new RUnit unit tests to test the above

Version 1.9
====================
* converted the main IO routines to Rcpp/C++
* lots of tweaks resulting from new RUnit tests in rmincIO.extras pkg
* removed dummy Rcpp code

Version 1.2
====================
* now using Makevars instead of .configure
* we can now write Rcpp code
* now using a NAMESPACE

Version 1.1
====================
* integrated proof-of-concept mniSurfaceIO package.

Version 1.0
====================
* rename from rminc2
* removed all of Jason's RMINC code

New in Version 0.5
====================
* initial import of RMINC 1.0.5 code
